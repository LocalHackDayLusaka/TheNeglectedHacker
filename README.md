# The Neglected Hacker
You are not alone. Here are a couple resources you dont usually find. The basis of this project is to provide people with resources for information that is not easy to access. We itemized a couple of categories that people struggle with finding valuable resources. We then searched for those resources and created a webpage. We also plan on making it a place where people can find other people who specialize in that particular topic and can form a community.
