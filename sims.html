<h1>Simulators</h1>

<p>A computer simulator is a program that simulates the execution of computer architecture. Simulators are used to enable access to unobtainable hardware,increasing the precision and volume of computer performance data.
There are different categories for architecture simulators and these include full system simulators and cycle accurate simulators.

<p>A full-system simulator is execution-driven architecture simulation at such a level of detail that complete software stacks from real systems can run on the simulator without any modification. A full system simulator provides virtual hardware that is independent of the nature of the host computer. The full-system model typically includes processor cores, peripheral devices, memories, interconnection buses, and network connections. Emulators are full system simulators that imitate obsolete hardware instead of under development hardware.

The defining property of full-system simulation compared to an instruction set simulator is that the model allows real device drivers and operating systems to be run, not just single programs. Thus, full-system simulation makes it possible to simulate individual computers and networked computer nodes with all their software, from network device drivers to operating systems, network stacks, middleware, servers, and application programs.

Full system simulation can speed the system development process by making it easier to detect, recreate and repair flaws. The use of multi-core processors is driving the need for full system simulation, because it can be extremely difficult and time-consuming to recreate and debug errors without the controlled environment provided by virtual hardware.[1] This also allows the software development to take place before the hardware is ready,[2] thus helping to validate design decisions.

<p>Simulation refers to using specified kind of techniques to imitate the operation in real world. It is derived from then modeling of the object in the real world. In computer engineering, simulation is one of the three main methods in analyzing computer systems. It requires less time than measuring the real system and can be done by computer programs. Gem5 and ESESC are two featured simulation tools for simulating computer system. In this paper, their features will be studied, validated and then summarized.
